# GO Playground

###### What is this project?
This project is a collection of go files that demonstrate different
features of the language. The files are copied from a number of different code
examples (see reference section), these are used to help enhance my own learning of the 
Go language.

###### How to run these go applications?
Download the source, in the directory the particular files are stored. 
Run the following:

`go run <file_name.go>`

###### How to build these go applications?
Download the source, in the directory the particular files are stored.
Run the following:

`go build <file_name.go>`

### How do I run tests
Navigate to a directory with tests and run:
_'go test'_
or for verbose logging:
_'go test -v'_ 


##### References
This project is a collection of different code snippets from a bunch of different sites.
